A planar graph $$G=(V,E)$$ is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e. it can be drawn in the plane so that no edges intersect except at the vertices. A subset $$S$$ of vertices in a graph $$G$$ is called a dominating set if every vertex $$v\in V$$ is either an element of $$S$$ or is adjacent to an element of $$S$$. The domination number of a graph $$G$$ is the smallest cardinality of a dominating set; we denote the domination number as $$\gamma(G)$$. Automated conjecture making is the process of having a computer generate conjectures. We investigate the domination number of planar graphs with the use of the automated conjecture making.
