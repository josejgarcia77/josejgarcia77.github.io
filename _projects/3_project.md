During the Edo period (1603 - 1868), the Japanese people generated Euclidean results that were quite different from those developed in the Western World.
Often they where drawn and painted on wooden tablets and placed in temples as acts of worship.
We investigate one of these problems that involves the incenter for a triangle generated from two tangent lines to a given circle.
We provide analogous results to this problems on the sphere, and provide a conjecture for the problem on the hyperbolic plane.
Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.
