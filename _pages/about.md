My research is in the area of computing topological invariants for physical systems using a composite operator approach. The work also has applications to non-Hermitian physics where there is still more theoretical work to be completed in terms of computing topological invariants. Another portion of my work is in regards to finding approximate joint eigenvectors of nearly commuting matrices, both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian case.

Outside of research, I am involved as a Steward for the Graduate Student Union of UNM. I also volunteer my time to Janet Kahn School of Integrated Arts Parent Teacher Association as the chair of the Communications Committee and a board member.

During my offtime I enjoy spending time with family. This can range from watching a movie, going camping, spending time at the park and traveling. I also enjoy writting to my pen pals and I'm a fan of anime and manga.
